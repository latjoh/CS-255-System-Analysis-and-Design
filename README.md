# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

# Summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well?
The client was a student driver training company. The client wanted me to build a software based system that would provide customers with access to better driver training through online classes and practice exams. I was able to gather essential business requirements and put together a system design.I was also able to successfully complete a series of UML use case diagrams and make a powerpoint presentation to the company owner.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would further modify the design document to provide more details of the business plan. I would also want to know more about what the business might need moving forward.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I wanted to be able to ensure that the system user would have a user-friendly experience while using this system. Its important to always consider the users needs as it directly impacts the business. Users would be reluctant to interact with a system that doesn't function well. And a well developed system may help attract new customers.
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would start by making a list of all the functional and non-functional requirements for the system design. It would be useful to have pre-defined templates to help capture the data points. I would also use UML diagrams to include use case diagrams in the system design.
